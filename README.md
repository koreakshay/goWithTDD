Not sure if I'm learning Go with TDD or TDD with Go

# Background
I want to grow from being curious about Go to becoming an effective writer of Go systems.

Found an awesome resource to learn from -> [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

The goal is to get good at programming in Go, learn TDD, and refactoring.

# Discipline
The cycle
- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor

On the face of it this may seem tedious but sticking to the feedback loop is important.
